A Great God Deserves Great Worship!

Calling God's People to Prayer

And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)


Riverside Baptist Church is a place where families, singles, young and old alike are all welcome.  We believe God has placed us here to serve the people of our community and to bring the Gospel of Jesus Christ around the world. Come and share in our vision and discover how the wonderful truths of the bible relate to everyday living.


“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”          John 3:16
